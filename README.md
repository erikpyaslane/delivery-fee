# Delivery Fee Calculation

Trial task for Java programming developers.

## Some useful tips

In REST controllers documentation is above each HTTP request method.

If application is launched on port 8080, then you can use URL below:
```
http://localhost:8080
```
There is a simple HTML file (created with Thymeleaf), where you can calculate delivery fees by filling the form inputs.

Examples of others HTTP requests can be found in documentation above each request method.

## Database
Database is included in the project repository. It contains all the necessary data. Database has some weather 
observations data, default regional base fees and business rules (all that are described in task description).
